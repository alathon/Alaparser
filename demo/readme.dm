/*

This demo features a very small world with two rooms, a few mobs, and some basics set up to
function with enough commands to illustrate most of the stuff you can do.

Of special note:

- To move between the rooms, use the east and west commands.

- To select the 2nd mob with a certain keyword, use 2.mobname (In this case 2.one)

- The tattoo command doesn't become available until level 5. Jump to level up.
